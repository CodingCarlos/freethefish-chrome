# Free the Fish
This extension protects you from lousy media content when surfing the web, blocking phony headlines and bot-written articles. Our goal with this project is to free the internet from clickbait, a shameful practice used by news media to generate traffic on their webpages.

# What you can do with it

## Detect clickbait headlines
Turn it on and never fall for the bait anymore. All clickbait-y content will be spotted on the page you are on. 

## Read spoilers written by the community
You can't help but wondering what is "THE ULTIMATE THING to wake up in great shape EVERY DAY"? With some chance, another user already read it and spoiled it for you to save you the reading time!

## Make the web a better place
We need a big community if we want to make a stand. You can use this extension as a read-only but you can also help make it better by:

### Report clickbait
See a typical clickbait headline? Report it and it will be added to a public ranking with media that get shamed most frequently.

### Write spoilers
You got fooled by a sexy headline and lost precious time reading a lousy article? Drop a spoiler so the next person won't be fooled üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
